## My process
I used the developer tools in the chrome to monitor the alignment and position of elements in their containers.
I used `CSS3` flexbox to postion the content to the right positions.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I realised there was `fonts` in the folder. This pushed me to learn how to include `web fonts` in local development.

I also got a great suggestion from [Daniel Moraes Mariz](@danielmrz-dev) on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) on how to write semantic HMTL for SEO purposes
